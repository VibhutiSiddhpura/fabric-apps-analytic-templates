 *
 * The shape of this declaration is load-bearing beyond the app. The eval
 * harness rewrites it to render outside Fabric, matching a top-level
 * `export const connectorRuntimes`, a closing `};` at column zero, and exactly
 * one `fabricSemanticModel(...)` call inside. Keep all three — see
 * `connectors.spec.ts`, which asserts them.
 *
 * @remarks
 * Do not pass a `target`. The workspace and item ids come from `rayfin.yml` and
 * are injected by whatever answers the Rayfin API, so the app never needs to
 * know them. Deriving one from a `VITE_*` variable throws at module load,
 * because `rayfin env` emits a fixed set of variables and a per-model URL is
 * not among them.
